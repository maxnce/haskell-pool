## Caution

/!\ If you are an Epitech student you should be aware by now that cheating is forbidden. If you are going to copy paste this code, do it at your own risks.

## Introduction
The Haskell Part of the paradigms seminar of Epitech. This quick introduction led me to discover a totally new paradigm which is functional programming.

I loved it so I'm definetely going to work on some more Haskell.
